product_name: "Jira-Style List View"
version: "1.0"
created_date: "2025-01-11"
status: "Draft"
priority: "High"

## Overview

A hierarchical list view component that displays project issues in a tree structure with rolled-up aggregate values, similar to Jira's list view functionality. The component provides expandable/collapsible groupings with calculated summary values for status, assignees, and effort metrics.

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Core List View
- **US-001**: As a user, I want to see issues organized in a hierarchical tree structure so I can understand parent-child relationships
- **US-002**: As a user, I want to expand/collapse work stream groups so I can focus on relevant sections
- **US-003**: As a user, I want to see individual issue details including key, summary, status, assignee, and effort
- **US-004**: As a user, I want proper visual indentation to understand the hierarchy depth

### Epic 2: Roll-up Calculations
- **US-005**: As a user, I want to see aggregated status percentages at the parent level so I can understand overall progress
- **US-006**: As a user, I want to see total assignee count rolled up to parent levels
- **US-007**: As a user, I want to see total effort and remaining effort calculated at parent levels
- **US-008**: As a user, I want stacked avatar circles showing all unique assignees in a work stream

### Epic 3: Visual Design
- **US-009**: As a user, I want color-coded work stream badges so I can quickly identify different streams
- **US-010**: As a user, I want status progress bars with appropriate colors for quick visual assessment
- **US-011**: As a user, I want effort remaining indicators with color coding (red=off track, yellow=at risk, green=on track)
- **US-012**: As a user, I want professional typography and spacing that matches Atlassian design standards

## Data Model

### Issue Type
```typescript
interface Issue {
  id: string;
  key: string;
  summary: string;
  status: 'TO DO' | 'IN PROGRESS' | 'DONE';
  assignee: Assignee;
  effort: number; // in hours
  effortRemaining: number; // in hours
  parentId?: string;
  children?: Issue[];
  issueType: 'story' | 'task' | 'epic';
  workStream?: string;
}
```

### Assignee Type
```typescript
interface Assignee {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  avatar: string;
  email: string;
}
```

### Work Stream Type
```typescript
interface WorkStream {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  color: 'pink' | 'blue' | 'orange' | 'purple';
  issues: Issue[];
}
```

### Roll-up Data Type
```typescript
interface RollupData {
  totalIssues: number;
  statusBreakdown: {
    todo: number;
    inProgress: number;
    done: number;
  };
  uniqueAssignees: Assignee[];
  totalEffort: number;
  totalEffortRemaining: number;
  trackingStatus: 'on-track' | 'at-risk' | 'off-track';
}
```
